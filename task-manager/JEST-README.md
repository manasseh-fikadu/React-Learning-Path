* The store should dispatch the addTask action and update the state.
* The store should dispatch the deleteTask action and update the state.
* The store should dispatch the toggleTaskStatus action and update the state.
* The store should dispatch the setFilter action and update the state.
* The store should integrate with React components.
## Additional Tests

The following are some additional tests that could be performed:

* Test the error handling in the App component.
* Test the performance of the App component.
* Test the accessibility of the App component.
* Test the internationalization of the App component.

These tests would provide additional coverage for the App component and ensure that it is working correctly in all scenarios.
