# React Typscrpit Hooks Demo

## Learning Process - React Hooks: useState, useEffect, and useRef

In this learning process README, I'll share understanding of using the React Hooks `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows functional components to use state and other features previously only available in class components.

### useState Hook

- The `useState` Hook was my first introduction to React Hooks. It allows functional components to manage state without the need for class components.
- At first, I reviewed the official React documentation for `useState` to understand its basic usage and syntax. I learned how to declare state variables using array destructuring, and the function to update those variables.
- I then created a simple React app to practice using `useState` to manage a counter value. This helped me grasp the concept of setting and updating state in functional components.

### useEffect Hook

- The `useEffect` Hook was the next topic I tackled. It provides a way to perform side effects in functional components, like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations.
- I explored the official documentation for `useEffect` to understand its purpose and how to use it correctly. I learned about its dependencies array and how it controls when the effect is re-run.

### useRef Hook

- The `useRef` Hook was the last topic in my learning journey. It allows functional components to create a mutable reference to a DOM element or any other value that persists across renders.
- I reviewed the official React documentation for `useRef` and understood its purpose in creating a reference to DOM elements or other values.
- To practice `useRef`, I implemented a simple feature in my counter app that used `useRef` to access the DOM button element and triggered a specific behavior when the button was clicked.
